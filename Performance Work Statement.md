TTS BPA for Software Development, Design, and Research

# **Performance Work Statement**

# 1.0 Background

The Technology Transformation Services (TTS) organization applies modern
methodologies and technologies to improve the public’s experience with
government by helping agencies make their services more accessible,
efficient, and effective, and by itself providing services that
exemplify these values. We build, provide, and share technology
applications, platforms, processes, personnel, and software solutions to
federal agencies in an effort to help them better serve the public.

# 2.0 Description of Work to be Performed

TTS seeks agile software development services. The services to be
provided will include all aspects of the software development process,
including initial planning, design, software development and coding,
prototyping, documentation, testing, and configuration.

These software development projects will use agile development
principles, with necessary documentation, human-centered design, and an
extensible infrastructure. TTS expects that the development process will
be collaborative and iterative, with open, regular, and frequent
communication between TTS and the Contractor. Using
[<span class="underline">the twelve
principles</span>](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)
established by the [<span class="underline">Agile
Manifesto</span>](http://agilemanifesto.org/) as well as our adoption of
[<span class="underline">Scrum</span>](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/scrum-guide),
there are a number of aspects to Agile development that will provide the
Government with a project management structure that will ensure
contractor performance is monitored and issues are immediately
addressed.

Usability testing and other user research methods must be conducted at
regular intervals throughout the development process (not just at the
beginning or end), with all electronic artifacts from usability testing
and/or other research methods with end-users being made available at the
end of every applicable sprint. All software code delivered under this
order shall comply with the [<span class="underline">18F open source
policy</span>](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/policy.md)
and the [<span class="underline">18F Accessibility
Guidelines</span>](https://accessibility.18f.gov/) as well as all
relevant federal legislation in effect as of the date of award.

# 3.0 General Requirements

The Contractor will provide the following services:

  - Contractor must develop web-based interactive systems using agile
    principles.

  - Contractor must conduct research activities using modern
    [<span class="underline">methodologies</span>](https://methods.18f.gov/),
    including stakeholder interviews and usability tests. Contractor
    shall create and deliver records and notes collected during their
    research.

  - Contractor must work with TTS to ensure that the system is
    compliant with security policies.

  - Contractor must ensure that the system includes user
    authentication and authorization functionality that uses open
    source encryption protocols.

  - Contractor must post all code to a publicly-available code
    repository, with a Public Domain license.

  - Contractor must ensure that the architecture is extensible to
    allow for further development, including integration with
    compatible internal or external systems (for example, integration
    with an instance of ServiceNow or Salesforce via an API).

  - Contractor must incorporate analytics, monitoring, continuous
    integration, and measurement tools into their code base.

  - Contractor must use [<span class="underline">plain
    language</span>](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) in application
    design and development whenever possible. In the event that TTS
    does not provide the Contractor with content-specific guidance or
    grammatical rules for the cloud marketplace tool, Contractor
    should adhere to [<span class="underline">18F’s content
    guide</span>](https://content-guide.18f.gov/).

  - Contractor must utilize the [<span class="underline">U.S. Web
    Design System</span>](https://standards.usa.gov/) or other
    development standards as developed by the 18F team.

# 4.0 Services and Pricing

All contractor personnel must have the experience, education, and
capability to perform required tasks. Below are the desired skill sets
required under the Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA). The Contractor must
propose firm, fixed-price hourly rates for the desired skill sets
identified in this section. The government intends to establish the
rates for the BPA and the labor categories listed below will be used as
part of the ordering process after award. Prices quoted shall be for new
orders placed during the ordering period. The government at any time
might change the type of labor categories required at the task order
level.
